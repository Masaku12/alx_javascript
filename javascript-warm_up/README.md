# Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. At ALX, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting.

## Tasks

### 0. First constant, first print

Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

- You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- You are not allowed to use var

```guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js 
JavaScript is amazing
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ semistandard 0-javascript_is_amazing.js 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$
```

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx_javascript`
